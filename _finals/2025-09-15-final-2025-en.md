## InformatiCup 2025: Open Source Contributions in Focus

In this year's finals of the student competition of the German Society for Informatics e.V., Open Source contributions took center stage. The participants worked on real Open Source projects and actively contributed to the community. The finals took place in parallel to the [INFORMATIK FESTIVAL 2025](https://informatik2025.gi.de/) at HPI Potsdam.

This year's task "Participate in the Open - Contribute to OSS as a Team!" challenged the teams to engage with existing Open Source projects and make valuable contributions. The goal was to overcome the barriers to Open Source contributions and achieve real community impact.
